# semanticNERF

Starting point: original NERF

#### 17-02-2020:
1. Add feature network
2. Use a single Color network for both coarse and fine NERF
3. Blender (whitebackground) function doesnt work. Dont know why ? If i remove the sigmoid function of the ColorNetwork then it is fine but then the background goes crazy, the content is fine though.
4. Training with LLFF first.
